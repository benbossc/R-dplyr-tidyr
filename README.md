# Setting Things Up

Let's use the readr package to read external data into R, for this lesson we are going to use the gapminder data.

```R
library("readr")
gapminder <- read_csv("data/gapminder_data.csv")
```

```{r}
── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
cols(
  country = col_character(),
  year = col_double(),
  pop = col_double(),
  continent = col_character(),
  lifeExp = col_double(),
  gdpPercap = col_double()
)
```
```R
gapminder
```
```{r}
# A tibble: 1,704 x 6
   country      year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
   <chr>       <dbl>    <dbl> <chr>       <dbl>     <dbl>
 1 Afghanistan  1952  8425333 Asia         28.8      779.
 2 Afghanistan  1957  9240934 Asia         30.3      821.
 3 Afghanistan  1962 10267083 Asia         32.0      853.
 4 Afghanistan  1967 11537966 Asia         34.0      836.
 5 Afghanistan  1972 13079460 Asia         36.1      740.
 6 Afghanistan  1977 14880372 Asia         38.4      786.
 7 Afghanistan  1982 12881816 Asia         39.9      978.
 8 Afghanistan  1987 13867957 Asia         40.8      852.
 9 Afghanistan  1992 16317921 Asia         41.7      649.
10 Afghanistan  1997 22227415 Asia         41.8      635.
# … with 1,694 more rows
```
Manipulation of dataframes means many things to many researchers, we often select certain observations (rows) or variables (columns), we often group the data by a certain variable(s), or we even calculate summary statistics. We can do these types of operations using the normal base R operations:
```R
mean(gapminder$gdpPercap)
```
```{r}
[1] 7215.327
```
The question here is how might you summarize split by some group you might be interested in.

# The ```dplyr``` Package 
Luckily, the dplyr package provides a number of very useful functions for manipulating dataframes in a way that will reduce the above repetition, reduce the probability of making errors, and probably even save you some typing. As an added bonus, you might even find the dplyr grammar easier to read.

Here we’re going to cover 5 of the most commonly used functions as well as using pipes (%>%) to combine them.
1. ```select()```
2. ```filter()```
3. ```group_by()```
4. ```summarize()```
5. ```mutate()```

If you have have not installed this package earlier, please do so:
```R
install.packages('dplyr')
```
Now let’s load the package:
```R
library("dplyr")
```
# Using select()

If, for example, we wanted to move forward with only a few of the variables in our dataframe we could use the select() function. This will keep only the variables you select.
```R
year_country_gdp <- select(gapminder, year, country, gdpPercap)
```
<img src = "fig/R-Dataframe-Manipulation-dplyr-fig1.png">

# Using filter()

To select on some subset of rows:
```R
filter(gapminder, continent == "Europe")
```
```{r}
# A tibble: 360 x 6
   country  year     pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
   <chr>   <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>       <dbl>     <dbl>
 1 Albania  1952 1282697 Europe       55.2     1601.
 2 Albania  1957 1476505 Europe       59.3     1942.
 3 Albania  1962 1728137 Europe       64.8     2313.
 4 Albania  1967 1984060 Europe       66.2     2760.
 5 Albania  1972 2263554 Europe       67.7     3313.
 6 Albania  1977 2509048 Europe       68.9     3533.
 7 Albania  1982 2780097 Europe       70.4     3631.
 8 Albania  1987 3075321 Europe       72       3739.
 9 Albania  1992 3326498 Europe       71.6     2497.
10 Albania  1997 3428038 Europe       73.0     3193.
# … with 350 more rows
```
Or select another subset of rows:
```R
filter(gapminder, pop > 1000000)
```
```{r}# A tibble: 1,524 x 6
   country      year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
   <chr>       <dbl>    <dbl> <chr>       <dbl>     <dbl>
 1 Afghanistan  1952  8425333 Asia         28.8      779.
 2 Afghanistan  1957  9240934 Asia         30.3      821.
 3 Afghanistan  1962 10267083 Asia         32.0      853.
 4 Afghanistan  1967 11537966 Asia         34.0      836.
 5 Afghanistan  1972 13079460 Asia         36.1      740.
 6 Afghanistan  1977 14880372 Asia         38.4      786.
 7 Afghanistan  1982 12881816 Asia         39.9      978.
 8 Afghanistan  1987 13867957 Asia         40.8      852.
 9 Afghanistan  1992 16317921 Asia         41.7      649.
10 Afghanistan  1997 22227415 Asia         41.8      635.
# … with 1,514 more rows
```
Above we used ‘normal’ grammar, but the strengths of dplyr lie in combining several functions using pipes. This <a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies/status/1172576445794803713">description</a> is very useful:
```{r}
I work up %>% 
  showered %>% 
  dressed %>% 
  had coffee %>% 
  came to an R workshop
```
Since the pipes grammar is unlike anything we’ve seen in R before, let’s repeat what we’ve done above using pipes.
```R
year_country_gdp <- gapminder %>% select(year, country, gdpPercap)
```
To help you understand why we wrote that in that way, let’s walk through it step by step. First we summon the gapminder dataframe and pass it on, using the pipe symbol %>%, to the next step, which is the select() function. In this case we don’t specify which data object we use in the select() function since in gets that from the previous pipe. Fun Fact: There is a good chance you have encountered pipes before in the shell. In R, a pipe symbol is %>% while in the shell it is | but the concept is the same!

# Using filter() with pipes
If we now wanted to move forward with the above, but only with European countries, we can combine select and filter
```R
year_country_gdp_euro <- gapminder %>%
    filter(continent == "Europe") %>%
    select(year, country, gdpPercap)
```
## Question 1

As with last time, first we pass the gapminder dataframe to the filter() function, then we pass the filtered version of the gapminder dataframe to the select() function. Note: The order of operations is very important in this case. If we used ‘select’ first, filter would not be able to find the variable continent since we would have removed it in the previous step.

Please now write a command line (which can spans multiples lines by relying on piping) that produces a data frame with the following criteria: 1) Asia and Oceania; 2) values for ```year```, ```country```, ```population```, and  ```lifeExp```. How many rows did you end up getting and why? 

# Using group_by() and summarize()

Now, we were supposed to be reducing the error prone repetitiveness of what can be done with base R, but up to now we haven’t done that since we would have to repeat the above for each continent. Instead of filter(), which will only pass observations that meet your criteria (in the above: continent=="Europe"), we can use group_by(), which will essentially use every unique criteria that you could have used in filter.
```R
gapminder
```
```{r}
# A tibble: 1,704 x 6
   country      year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
   <chr>       <dbl>    <dbl> <chr>       <dbl>     <dbl>
 1 Afghanistan  1952  8425333 Asia         28.8      779.
 2 Afghanistan  1957  9240934 Asia         30.3      821.
 3 Afghanistan  1962 10267083 Asia         32.0      853.
 4 Afghanistan  1967 11537966 Asia         34.0      836.
 5 Afghanistan  1972 13079460 Asia         36.1      740.
 6 Afghanistan  1977 14880372 Asia         38.4      786.
 7 Afghanistan  1982 12881816 Asia         39.9      978.
 8 Afghanistan  1987 13867957 Asia         40.8      852.
 9 Afghanistan  1992 16317921 Asia         41.7      649.
10 Afghanistan  1997 22227415 Asia         41.8      635.
# … with 1,694 more rows
```
```R
gapminder %>% group_by(continent)
```
```{r}
# A tibble: 1,704 x 6
# Groups:   continent [5]
   country      year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
   <chr>       <dbl>    <dbl> <chr>       <dbl>     <dbl>
 1 Afghanistan  1952  8425333 Asia         28.8      779.
 2 Afghanistan  1957  9240934 Asia         30.3      821.
 3 Afghanistan  1962 10267083 Asia         32.0      853.
 4 Afghanistan  1967 11537966 Asia         34.0      836.
 5 Afghanistan  1972 13079460 Asia         36.1      740.
 6 Afghanistan  1977 14880372 Asia         38.4      786.
 7 Afghanistan  1982 12881816 Asia         39.9      978.
 8 Afghanistan  1987 13867957 Asia         40.8      852.
 9 Afghanistan  1992 16317921 Asia         41.7      649.
10 Afghanistan  1997 22227415 Asia         41.8      635.
# … with 1,694 more rows
```
You will notice that the structure of the dataframe where we used group_by() (grouped_df) is not the same as the original gapminder (data.frame). A grouped_df can be thought of as a list where each item in the list is a data.frame which contains only the rows that correspond to the a particular value continent (at least in the example above).
<img src = "fig/R-Dataframe-Manipulation-dplyr-fig2.png">

# Using summarize()
The above was a bit on the uneventful side but group_by() is much more exciting in conjunction with summarize(). This will allow us to create new variable(s) by using functions that repeat for each of the continent-specific data frames. That is to say, using the group_by() function, we split our original dataframe into multiple pieces, then we can run functions (e.g. mean() or sd()) within summarize().
```R
gdp_bycontinents <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))
```
```{r}
`summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)
```
<img src = "fig/R-Dataframe-Manipulation-dplyr-fig3.png">

```{r}
# A tibble: 5 x 2
  continent mean_gdpPercap
  <chr>              <dbl>
1 Africa             2194.
2 Americas           7136.
3 Asia               7902.
4 Europe            14469.
5 Oceania           18622.
```

That allowed us to calculate the mean gdpPercap for each continent, but it gets even better.

## Question 2 

The function group_by() allows us to group by multiple variables. Let’s group by year and continent.

```R
gdp_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))
```

```{r}
`summarise()` regrouping output by 'continent' (override with `.groups` argument)
```
That is already quite powerful, but it gets even better! You’re not limited to defining 1 new variable in summarize().
```R
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop = mean(pop),
              sd_pop = sd(pop))
```
```{r}
`summarise()` regrouping output by 'continent' (override with `.groups` argument)
```

Only include non-European countries and calculate the average life expectancy per country. Which has the longest average life expectancy and which has the shortest average life expectancy? Which country/countries represent(s) the median life expectancy (rounded to the whole number)?

# Using Using count()

A very common operation is to count the number of observations for each group. The dplyr package comes with a function that helps with this.

For instance, if we wanted to check the number of countries included in the dataset for the year 2002, we can use the count() function. It takes the name of one or more columns that contain the groups we are interested in, and we can optionally sort the results in descending order by adding sort=TRUE:

```R
gapminder %>%
    filter(year == 2002) %>%
    count(continent, sort = TRUE)
```
```{r}
# A tibble: 5 x 2
  continent     n
  <chr>     <int>
1 Africa       52
2 Asia         33
3 Europe       30
4 Americas     25
5 Oceania       2
```
# Using Using mutate()

We can also create new variables prior to (or even after) summarizing information using mutate().
```R
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    mutate(gdp_billion = gdpPercap*pop/10^9) %>%
    group_by(continent,year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop = mean(pop),
              sd_pop = sd(pop),
              mean_gdp_billion = mean(gdp_billion),
              sd_gdp_billion = sd(gdp_billion))
```
```{r}
`summarise()` regrouping output by 'continent' (override with `.groups` argument)
```
# Connect mutate with logical groupings: ifelse
When creating new variables, we can hook this with a logical condition. A simple combination of mutate() and ifelse() facilitates filtering right where it is needed: in the moment of creating something new. This easy-to-read statement is a fast and powerful way of discarding certain data (even though the overall dimension of the data frame will not change) or for updating values depending on this given condition.
```R
## keeping all data but "filtering" after a certain condition
# calculate GDP only for people with a life expectation above 25
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear_above25 <- gapminder %>%
    mutate(gdp_billion = ifelse(lifeExp > 25, gdpPercap * pop / 10^9, NA)) %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop = mean(pop),
              sd_pop = sd(pop),
              mean_gdp_billion = mean(gdp_billion),
              sd_gdp_billion = sd(gdp_billion))
```
```{r}
`summarise()` regrouping output by 'continent' (override with `.groups` argument)
```
```R
## updating only if certain condition is fullfilled
# for life expectations above 40 years, the gpd to be expected in the future is scaled
gdp_future_bycontinents_byyear_high_lifeExp <- gapminder %>%
    mutate(gdp_futureExpectation = ifelse(lifeExp > 40, gdpPercap * 1.5, gdpPercap)) %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              mean_gdpPercap_expected = mean(gdp_futureExpectation))
```
# Questions 3-4

## Q3

Which European country and associated year has the shortest life expectacy? Which European country and associated has the longest life expectancy? 

## Q4

Filter to only include years 1990-2010. Creates a new variable totalAvgLifeExp, grouped by continents, that includes: cumulative (as in, representative of 1990-2010) average life expectancy.
